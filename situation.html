         <p style="color:#fff"> We all know disasters happen, whether it be natural disasters or global pandemics,<br>
            but usually they don’t hit so close to home for most of us and hence we successfully <br>
         “otherise” them to another part of the world or to another community somewhere far away from us.
         <br>But, with the COVID19’s “forest fire” nature, it’s better to take preventive measures and be<br>
             geared to respond immediately!  start by applying practicality and common  sense by following <br>
             instructions given to avoid spread of covid.

            <h2 style="color:yellow" > visualization beyond what we can see and the current situation?</h2>
         <img src="img/tst.png">
         <p style="color:#fff">I strongly believe in power of visualisation we must see that image in our<br>
                mind before we ever venture forth to manifest it, Patricia is one of my <br>
                favourite example of her Son Trevor Noah, her  being his daily and forever mentor,<br>
                she didn't assumed her son had a vission but instead put him in the line where,<br>
                she spent alot of time telling him do's and dont's,especially about women (page27) <br>
                I remember how she was preoccupied with teaching him how to be a man and not a boy<br>
                 perhaps Trevor Noah grows <br>
                 into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was <br>
                 never supposed to exist, world built on institutionalized racism, unjust, world where <br>
                 race-mixing becomes a crime worse than treason. The bond between Patricia the fearless,<br>
                  courageous, and God fearing woman who is a mother to Trevor seems to be strong enough that <br>
                  she is ever focused to  cover courage, displine, hope, determined to make her son feel loved,<br>
                   comfortable and never feel like he is a  reject.I admire her vision, on how she raised her<br>
                son as if there were no limitation of on where he could go or what he could do. With love and <br>
                care she is determined to give Noah everything she never had and made him what he is today. <br>
                with hyper focus and complete confidence, she is never too far from getting back what she expected from her son<br></p>
                <h  style="color:whitesmoke">Book Review: Born a Crime by Trevor Noah</h>
               <p style="color:white"> When Trevor Noah succeeded Jon Stewart as host<br>
                                        <br>of “The Daily Show” last year, the 32-year-old 
                                        South African comedian had huge shoes to fill.<br>
                                        Could he prove himself a worthy successor? Who was<br>
                                         he, anyway? In his fascinating memoir, Born a Crime, <b>
                                            we get to know Comedy Central’s import, and the <br>
                                            evidence is clear: Challenges are nothing new to Noah.
                                           Engaging and insightful, Born a Crime is not a rags-to-riches<br>
                                            story; the memoir ends before Noah finds success. Instead, the<br>
                                             book reveals the hard details of a grim life: a mother and son who,<br>
                                              together, survived the cruelties of apartheid and domestic violence.<br>
                                               Ironically, today it is Noah’s perspective as an outsider that serves<br>
                                                him so well in his starring role in U.S. comedy.</p>

         <img src="img/tst.png">
         <p style="color:#fff"> Spend some time each week taking stock of your vision, <br>
                                    and evaluating which aspects of it are, or are not,<br> 
            represented in your weekly schedule. Maybe you’ve got a <br>
            lot of fitness and healthy-activity images in your vision <br>
            board. Are you keeping up with your commitment to your running group? <br>
             A weekly sit-down with the vision board is a great way to check in <br>
             with yourself and see where the discrepancies are.<br>
             You can also use your vision board or journal to galvanize<br> your focus
              and sense of purpose when your motivation flags.If you’re <br>
              spinning with self-doubt before a difficult phone call, looking <br>
              at your vision board may help you center yourself and remind you why<br> 
              you’re doing what you’re doing: To win the job you want, you need<br>
               to ask for the interview. To buy your dream house, you’ve got to <br>
               go through the mortgage process. Restoring the big picture in your <br>
               brain can be an incredibly effective way to reduce anxiety and build<br>
               your sense of connection to your higher goal. And that’s what 
               visioning is all about.</p>
